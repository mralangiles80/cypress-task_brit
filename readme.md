Auto test task for Tahir

Instructions for setup:

run in console to install Cypress locally:
- npm install cypress --save-dev
- npx cypress open

see video in /results-vid for passing test run in Chrome

some notes:

- simplest framework was implemented with 1 spec file as the scope of the task was small
- only desktop view was included (nav menu differs)
- possible improvements could be: create arrays/lists to contain multiple search queries and expected results, and multiple office addresses
